# Rclone Link

This is a simple python script designed to work with rclone and inotify to keep a directory contents synchronised with a remote source (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

I developed it to work with Obsidian or other similar note-taking apps on different devices.

Because it uses inotifywait it will only work on Linux systems. I might update it for MacOS / Windows if there's interest.
